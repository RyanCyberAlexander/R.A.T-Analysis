# SIEM WIRESHARK R.A.T-Analysis PROJECT
This Project aims to analyze what a R.A.T may try to do on a system.

## Introduction
This project investigates network traffic generated by a **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** from Malware Traffic Analysis. I will be focusing on identifying its **communication patterns**, methods of **data exfiltration**, and how it employs **encryption** to avoid detection. The analysis uses data captured from a **malicious PCAP file**, which was analyzed with **Wireshark** and **Splunk**.

Using Wireshark for packet-level analysis and Splunk for log aggregation and visualization, this project demonstrates how to identify key indicators of compromise (IoCs) from network traffic, such as:
- **Encrypted communications** (e.g., TLS)
- **Unusual packet sizes**, indicating potential data exfiltration
- **Multiple Command and Control (C2) IP addresses**, suggesting a distributed RAT infrastructure

## What I Did

In this project, I first set up a controlled environment to perform the analysis of the **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** network traffic. Here's a breakdown of the setup and the steps I followed:

### 1. **Environment Setup**
   - **Virtual Machine (VM) Setup**: I used **VirtualBox** to create a virtual machine (VM) for conducting the analysis. I allocated:
     - **4 GB of RAM** from my host machine (out of a total 16 GB)
     - **4 CPU cores** from my host machine (out of a total of 8 cores)
     - **50 GB of storage** from my host machine which has 2 TB
   - **Operating System**: I installed **Windows 10** as the operating system for the VM. Windows 10 is the most popular OS and commonly targeted by malware, making it a good choice for analyzing real-world traffic.
   - **Tools Installation**: After setting up the VM, I installed the necessary tools for the analysis:
     - **Wireshark** for packet-level network traffic analysis.
     - **Splunk** for log aggregation, data parsing, and visualization.
     - Downloaded a **malicious R.A.T PCAP file** from **Malware Traffic Analysis** to simulate the real-world network traffic that a RAT might generate.

### 2. **PCAP File Analysis with Wireshark**
   - **Captured Network Traffic**: I loaded the provided **PCAP file** into **Wireshark** to observe the raw packet data.
   - **Identified Key Protocols**: I identified that the RAT primarily used **TCP** and **TLS** (specifically **TLSv1.2** and **TLSv1.3**) for encrypted communication with the Command and Control (C2) servers.
   - **Analyzed Traffic Patterns**: I analyzed the traffic for indicators of compromise (IoCs), such as unusual **destination IPs** and **large packet sizes**, which could be indicative of **data exfiltration**.

### 3. **Data Aggregation and Visualization with Splunk**
   - **Imported CSV Data**: After parsing the **PCAP data** into a **CSV format**, I imported the data into **Splunk** to gain better insight into the volume and patterns of the network traffic.
   - **Generated Reports**: I generated multiple reports to visualize the network traffic, focusing on:
     - **Top Destinations (IP addresses)**: Identified which IPs the RAT communicated with the most. The ip 10.3.10.101, which accounted for 8,209 occurrences, or 73.531% of the total events was reported to the most from the R.A.T. Since this is a 10.x.x.x ip this makes me believe the R.A.T is on a local machine more likely an active directory. This is where I struggled the most. I could not figure out why I could not see failed logins and thought I was doing something wrong. I googled it and found out since the R.A.T was using encryption it could hide login attempts from me. This made me feel better as I was very lost on this part of the project.

- **Protocols Used**: Determined which protocols (TCP, TLS) were employed by the RAT for communication. I could not find failed logins, this made me believe the R.A.T already had credentials it harvested. Or, it could have encrypted the failed logins with the TLS protocol.

- **Packet Length Analysis**: Visualized the distribution of packet sizes to help identify potential data exfiltration patterns. The packet lengths are large. A lot go over 1500 which probably means the packet header is increasing the size of the packets because from Splunk the largest packets I found were 1460. The unusually large packet sizes may indicate attempts at large-scale data exfiltration, potentially using techniques to bypass standard detection methods.

- **Created Dashboards**: Visualized the findings using **Splunkâ€™s visualization tools** (e.g., tables, bar charts) for better data interpretation.

### 4. **Conclusion**
   - The analysis revealed that the RAT was communicating with multiple C2 servers, sending data in encrypted packets, and utilizing large packet sizes, which likely indicate attempts to exfiltrate data. By mapping this traffic and using **Splunk** for further analysis, I was able to identify several potential **Command and Control (C2) IPs** and the **traffic patterns** they exhibited.
